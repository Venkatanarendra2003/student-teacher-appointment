1. **Firebase Account**: Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Web Browser**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
3. **Text Editor**: Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following services:
   - **Authentication** (Email/Password)
   - **Firestore Database**
   - **Realtime Database** (optional, for real-time features)

### Step 2: Configure Firebase

1. In your Firebase project, go to **Project Settings**
2. Scroll down to **Your apps** section
3. Click **Add app** and select **Web**
4. Register your app and copy the configuration
5. Open `firebase-config.js` and replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Step 3: Firestore Security Rules

Set up Firestore security rules in your Firebase console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
    }
    
    // Appointments collection
    match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.studentId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.teacherId == request.auth.uid ||
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
    }
    
    // Messages collection
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.fromId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.toId == request.auth.uid ||
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
    }
    
    // Logs collection (admin only)
    match /logs/{logId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

1. **Local Development**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
     npx http-server
     ```

2. **Firebase Hosting** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase Hosting
